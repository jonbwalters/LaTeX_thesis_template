\chapter*{PREFACE}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{PREFACE}

Place preface here, if a preface is desired.
(Many CAM and MS theses do not have a preface, because the
introduction serves the purpose that a preface would
in a book.)


Otherwise (likely the default option), comment out 
the lines 
$\setminus $newpage 
and 
$\setminus $include$\{ $preface$\} $
in phd\underline{~}thesis.tex.
