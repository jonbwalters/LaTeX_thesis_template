{\bf Put your appendices here. All codes stay the same, except that 
the first page of an appendix should only have the 
headings, so follow $\setminus $chapter with a 
$\setminus $clearpage. Codes in phd\underline{~}thesis.tex
take care of naming a $\setminus $chapter an ``APPENDIX."}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Appendices are optional. They must contain extra, relevant material such as
questionnaires, surveys, tables, figures, computer data, and letters of permission
to reprint copyrighted material. These optional appendices must be listed in the
Table of Contents, conforming to the format used there. They must also be
formatted in the document in such a way that they are consistent with the other
main divisions.
\item
Appendices must be cited in the Body of the document.
\item
All material in appendixes must be numbered consecutively, within the required
margins, and on the same paper used throughout the document.
\item
All appendices must have a title page. The title page of each Appendix must have
the Arabic page number centered between the left and right margins between $1/2$
inch and 1 inch from the bottom edge of the page. Place the Arabic page number
at the top right of subsequent pages of each Appendix.
\item
The Title page must have the word APPENDIX typed in all capital letters 2
inches from the top of the page followed by an informative title in all capital
letters. If there is more than one appendix, then label the first title page as
APPENDIX A, the second APPENDIX B, and so on, providing an
informative title for each appendix.
