{\bf Put your abstract here.}
This
\LaTeX \ 
template for MS and Ph.D. theses automatically takes care 
of most formatting requirements for theses submitted at Louisiana
Tech University.
A short tutorial on \LaTeX \ 
as well as an indication of issues that must be 
handled on a case-by-case basis is included.

If the abstract splits over two pages, \LaTeX \ will
take care of the page numbering.
