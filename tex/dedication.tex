{\em 
Note that the above is an example of a margin violation 
that would need to be fixed manually. \LaTeX \ 
usually does a good job splitting words correctly between two lines. 
Issues only arise with words from other languages or with 
character combinations like 
``phd\underline{~}thesis.tex"
above.}
