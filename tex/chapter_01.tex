{\bf Put your introduction here.}


Typesetting in \LaTeX \ is {\em the} way to communicate mathematics
(journal articles, books, MS theses, doctoral dissertations),
and \LaTeX \ is also popular in other disciplines, such as 
physics or computer science. This template should make the formatting
of your thesis easier. It is set up so that, unless there are some really
wide equations or figures, all margins should automatically be correct.
Similarly, all parts are in the order required by the graduate school and 
the required tables (listing contents, figures, tables)
are created automatically in the required format. 
The template is compiled by running \LaTeX \ on 
the file \verb+thesis.tex+. The only parts of 
\verb+thesis.tex+ that you should change are
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb+\include{...}+ commands: Add more to accommodate all the
	parts of your thesis and comment out those that do not apply. 
	\item \verb+\usepackage{...}+ commands: to import commands
	and environments that other people have created.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
For the actual software,
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mik\TeX~\cite{MiKTeX}
	is a standard \LaTeX\ distribution for Windows and
	WinEdt~\cite{WinEdt} is a standard front end.
	WinEdt asks for a registration fee. 
	The similar \TeX nicCenter~\cite{TeXnicCenter}
	is free. 
	\item Mac\TeX~\cite{MacTeX} is the standard MacOS distribution.
	It comes with the \TeX Shop editor.
	\item \TeX\ Live~\cite{TeXLive} is the standard Linux distribution.
	\item Overleaf~\cite{overleaf} is a convenient web app for hosting and 
	editing your \TeX projects.
\end{itemize}
A more thorough introduction to contemporary \LaTeX\ can be
found in the \LaTeX\ Wikibook~\cite{Wikibook}.

This document has been configured to use Bib\LaTeX~\cite{biblatex} to
automatically typeset your bibliography. All you need to do is use
\verb+\cite{...}+ with a given key from \verb+bib.bib+, and everything
will be taken care of. There are a variety of bibliography managers you might use rather than directly editing your bib file. Bibdesk comes with Mac\TeX, but most distributions don't include a manager. Consult \url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software} for a suitable application

I set the bibliography to use IEEE style, but it supports
a variety of needs. You only need to change the options in 
\verb+\usepackage[...]{biblatex}+ in \verb+thesis.tex+ to 
suit most formatting options.
