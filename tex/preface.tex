\chapter*{PREFACE}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{PREFACE}

Place preface here, if a preface is desired.
(Many CAM and MS theses do not have a preface, because the
introduction serves the purpose that a preface would
in a book.)


Otherwise, comment out 
the line
\verb+\include{tex/preface}+
in \verb+thesis.tex+.
