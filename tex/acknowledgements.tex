Place acknowledgements here, if acknowledgements are desired.
For an example, see below.

I (B. Schr\"oder) thank Dr. Lisa Kuhn for letting me use her
dissertation's source code as the basis for this template.
The hard work was done by her. I only inserted hints and a
tutorial on \LaTeX \
that I had on hand.


If no acknowledgements are desired, comment out
the line
\verb+\include{tex/acknowledgements}+
in \verb+thesis.tex+.

{\em 
Note that the above is an example of a margin violation 
that would need to be fixed manually. \LaTeX \ 
usually does a good job splitting words correctly between two lines. 
Issues only arise with words from other languages or with 
math expressions, verbatim text, and other combinations 
which normally don't allow line breaks.
