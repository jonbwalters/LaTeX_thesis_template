\bibitem{bib1}
Author A,
First entry in the bibliography.


For bibliographies single space the entries and put a double space between
entries.

BTW, \LaTeX \ measurements are
as follows. Double space: 24pt = 0.3in in between lines.
Triple space: 36pt = 0.6in between lines


\bibitem{bib2}
Author B,
Second entry in the bibliography.

\bibitem{bib3}
Caution:
Use the formatting style that is common in your discipline.
{\em None of the entries in this file should be considered a sample entry.}

\bibitem{warning}
Do {\bf not} split bibliography entries between two pages.
Use $\setminus $clearpage commands to introduce hard page breaks
as necessary.
I tried to put in a split entry, but it may well be that
\LaTeX \ avoids bad splits automatically.
