The files in this package constitute the Louisiana Tech LaTeX thesis template that can be used for typesetting MS and Ph.D. theses in LaTeX. If used correctly, the template should take care of most formatting issues, so that you can concentrate on sound technical writing instead of margin widths etc. The file LA_Tech_thesis.pdf contains an overall description and instructions. To get started with the actual typesetting, you must install a LaTeX compiler, such as MiKTeX, see

http://miktex.org/

MiKTeX does not provide a front end, so installation of a package such as TeXnicCenter

http://www.texniccenter.org/

is recommended. Install MiKTeX first, then the front end, then follow the front end package's instructions about connecting it to MiKTeX.

Typesetting in LaTeX takes a little getting used to, but not much. Recompile the file LA_Tech_thesis.tex to get a first idea how to use LaTeX and 

***********READ THE FILE LA_Tech_thesis.dvi or LA_Tech_thesis.pdf*********

Reading the file LA_Tech_thesis.dvi would be preferable, because then you can also get used to switching between dvi and source code.

For questions not answered in LA_Tech_thesis or in standard LaTeX references and for issues with the template, contact Dr. Bernd Schroeder.
