The files in this package constitute the Louisiana Tech LaTeX thesis template that can be used for typesetting MS and Ph.D. theses in LaTeX. If used correctly, the template should take care of most formatting issues, so that you can concentrate on sound technical writing instead of margin widths etc. The file LA_Tech_thesis.pdf contains an overall description and instructions. To get started with the actual typesetting, you must find a LaTeX package, such as Overleaf, MiKTeX, MacTeX, or TeX Live.

Typesetting in LaTeX takes a little getting used to, but not much. Recompile the file `thesis.tex` to get a first idea how to use LaTeX, and read the document along with the source code.

For questions not answered here or in standard LaTeX references and for issues with the template, contact Dr. Bernd Schroeder.
